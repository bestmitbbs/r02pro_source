## Covariance and Correlation   {#covariance_correlation}

In this section, we will dive further into statistics, this time talking about the relationship among variables. For two random variables $X$ and $Y$, the covariance between them is defined as $Cov(X, Y) = E[(X-E(X))(Y-E(Y))]$. 

```{r}
set.seed(724)
n <- 1e5
x1 <- rnorm(n)
x2 <- x1 + rnorm(n)
x3 <- x2 + rnorm(n)
cor(x1, x2)
cor(x1, x3)
cor(x2, x3)
x <- data.frame(x1, x2, x3)
cor(x) #correlation matrix
cov(x) #covariance matrix
```


### Exercise

You can run the following code to do the exercise. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
r02pro("8.4")
```
