## Matching Pattern with Regular Expressions {#match-pattern}

In many applications, we may want to find out which strings match a certain pattern.  To illustrate this, we will be using the variable names from the `ahp` data set from **r02pro** package. 

```{r}
library(r02pro)
library(stringr)
ahp_names <- colnames(ahp)
```

The **stringr** package provides a very useful function called `str_view()` to highlight the elements that match the given pattern. Let's describe a few commonly usd patterns.

***a. contain a given string***
To find all strings that contain `"yr"`, you can run the following code.
```{r, results = TRUE}
str_view(ahp_names, "yr")
```
